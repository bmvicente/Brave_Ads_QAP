# Brave Ads x Quadratic Attention Payments Mechanism Proposal

The Quadratic Attention Payments (QAP) mechanism aims to redefine digital advertising by empowering users to help determine the content they see and incentivize advertisers to create higher-quality, more relevant content.

Brave Ads’ fundamental goal is to accurately value and monetize user engagement with ads. The QAP mechanism not only aligns with that but enhances Brave Ads’ vision for a user-attention economy. It leverages Brave's existing attention-tracking capabilities, enabling users to vote on ads based on their preference, with a quadratic fee applied post-vote. This revenue-generating fee for advertisers, derived from user votes, encourages higher-quality ads.

Our goal is to create such an ecosystem where users experience fewer, more tailored ads, where publishers and advertisers gain better insights into users’ preferences for improved target advertising, and, in the meantime, maintain and boost a balanced distribution of revenue between all parties.
